# Predicting Construction Accident Severity Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to predict the severity of construction site accidents using classification models. By analyzing various risk factors, including environmental conditions, human behavior, and task assignments, the model aims to enhance safety management in the construction industry.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Programming & Data Processing**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM
- **Data Preprocessing**: One-Hot Encoding, Frequency Encoding, Feature Scaling
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy

## 📊 Results
- Achieved **92% accuracy** using **XGBoost and LightGBM**, outperforming other models.
- Implemented **feature importance analysis** to identify key accident risk factors.
- Developed a **data-driven approach** for **risk assessment and preventive safety measures**.
